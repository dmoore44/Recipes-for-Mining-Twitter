# Overview

This repository contains code for the now defunct [21 Recipes for Mining Twitter](http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920018261) (O'Reilly, 2011) book. The content from this book and its source code has been absorbed into [Mining the Social Web, 2nd Edition](http://bit.ly/135dHfs) (O'Reilly, 2013), which has its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition) maintained by the same author.

Although code in this repository has been freshened to be compatible with Twitter's v1.1 API changes as of mid-April 2013 and should be functional for you to use, the code in this repository will not be maintained moving forward. This repository was forked so the code would remain available after the original has been deleted. Moving forward, it is highly recommended that you reference [Mining the Social Web, 2nd Edition](http://bit.ly/135dHfs) and its updated/maintained GitHub repository.
